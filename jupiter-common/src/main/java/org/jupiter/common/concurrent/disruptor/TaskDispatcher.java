/**
 * 可选择的等待策略, 越往下越极端:
 *
 * The default wait strategy used by the Disruptor is the BlockingWaitStrategy.
 *
 * BlockingWaitStrategy:
 * Internally the BlockingWaitStrategy uses a typical lock and condition variable to handle thread wake-up.
 * The BlockingWaitStrategy is the slowest of the available wait strategies,
 * but is the most conservative with the respect to CPU usage and will give the most consistent behaviour across
 * the widest variety of deployment options. However, again knowledge of the deployed system can allow for additional
 * performance.
 *
 * SleepingWaitStrategy:
 * Like the BlockingWaitStrategy the SleepingWaitStrategy it attempts to be conservative with CPU usage,
 * by using a simple busy wait loop, but uses a call to LockSupport.parkNanos(1) in the middle of the loop.
 * On a typical Linux system this will pause the thread for around 60µs.
 * However it has the benefit that the producing thread does not need to take any action other increment the appropriate
 * counter and does not require the cost of signalling a condition variable. However, the mean latency of moving the
 * event between the producer and consumer threads will be higher. It works best in situations where low latency is not
 * required, but a low impact on the producing thread is desired. A common use case is for asynchronous logging.
 *
 * YieldingWaitStrategy:
 * The YieldingWaitStrategy is one of 2 Wait Strategies that can be use in low latency systems,
 * where there is the option to burn CPU cycles with the goal of improving latency.
 * The YieldingWaitStrategy will busy spin waiting for the sequence to increment to the appropriate value.
 * Inside the body of the loop Thread.yield() will be called allowing other queued threads to run.
 * This is the recommended wait strategy when need very high performance and the number of Event Handler threads is
 * less than the total number of logical cores, e.g. you have hyper-threading enabled.
 *
 * BusySpinWaitStrategy:
 * The BusySpinWaitStrategy is the highest performing Wait Strategy, but puts the highest constraints on the deployment
 * environment. This wait strategy should only be used if the number of Event Handler threads is smaller than the number
 * of physical cores on the box. E.g. hyper-threading should be disabled
